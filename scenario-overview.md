# Scenario Overview

An IT administrator is required to configure user authentication
on a Windows 11 device (SEA-WS3).

The task involves:
- Creating local user accounts
- Assigning administrator privileges
- Configuring Microsoft account sign-in
- Enabling Windows Hello with a PIN
- Reverting the device back to local authentication

This scenario reflects common enterprise IT support and endpoint
administration responsibilities.
